# Libft - 42 Network Project

Libft is a custom C library designed to implement essential functions that are typically provided by the standard C library. It includes various functions for string manipulation, memory handling, and other utilities. The project is a key part of the 42 Network curriculum and helps to reinforce understanding of low-level C programming and memory management.

üöÄ **Features**  
- Implements basic string manipulation functions such as `ft_strlen`, `ft_strcpy`, `ft_strcmp`, and more.  
- Includes memory manipulation functions like `ft_memset`, `ft_memcpy`, and `ft_bzero`.  
- Provides functions for handling lists, such as linked list creation and manipulation (`t_list` structure).  
- Offers utility functions for handling file descriptors and dynamic memory allocation.
